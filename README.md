Async Design Forum 


## Software Engineering Design Process:
Most modern software is created a keystroke at a time by many folks over time. Software is built in an iterative manner where small pieces of functionality are added to the software to the point where it can be released.  
The design process aims at involving as many people in the software design process to share context and gather feedback. Like documentation, most engineers see the design process as an overhead to delivering their features because most design processes are laser focused on design documents (artifacts).   
We would like a design process where shared understanding is the goal and artifacts (like design documents) are just a by product, or tool for shared understanding. Async conversations become the basis of shared understanding. It is important that these conversations are captured in a shared forum where folks are able to participate asynchronous and also giving folks enough time to respond and provide feedback. Remember the conversation is basis of the design.  Iteratively then the engineer can start fleshing out pieces of an artifact that captures some salient characteristics of the design in a condensed form.  
There may be a need for sync communication to enhance once enough shared content is achieved but not enough understanding is held within the team. The sync meetings need not be long but should focus on addressing questions already asked in the async forum with out resolution.
